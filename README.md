This is a clone from CodePlex, which is now closed.  https://windowsappboss.codeplex.com. While it may *look* like I wrote this in 2017, it was actually 2013 :) . **Download the current release** (again, from 2013) [here](https://github.com/jason-grimme/WindowsAppBoss/releases/tag/1.0.2.3).

## About

**Windows App Boss** is a utility that allows you to:

* Add, remove, and register test signed apps
* Add, remove, and register provisioned apps with license and custom.data files.
* Manage (Create, Remove, Swap) snapshots of app state (LocalState & settings.dat)
* Add, Remove, Update Windows Developer License
* View settings (settings.dat) of any windows app in plain text
* View preload (custom.data) files
* Enable / Disable app sideloading (AllowAllTrustedApps)
* Launch apps that do not appear on start screen

**Windows App Boss** is a free tool written by Jason Grimme in hopes of assisting other Windows Store App developers. It provides a GUI for installing Windows Store Apps (developer packages and signed apps as provisioned packages). Windows App Boss allows users to avoid using Powershell and DISM APIs to add, remove, and manage apps. 
**Windows App Boss is not affiliated with, or supported by Microsoft.**
